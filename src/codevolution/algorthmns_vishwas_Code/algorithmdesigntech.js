//Algorithmn Design Techniques

//1. Bruce Force -- e.g Linear search --evaluates all posible outcomes then chose the best

//2. Greedy -- e.g Dijkstra' algorithm,prim algr, kruskal's algrm  (mostly in graphs)
            //-- Chooses best approach for current time without future considerations

//3. Divide and Conquer -- e.g binary-search,Merge sort,Quicksort and Tower of Hanoi
                       //--divide problem to smaller,fix the small prob then recombine to get finall solution

//4.Dynamic Programming -- e.g Climbing Stairs, Fibonacci
                        //-- just like divide and conquer,split into subproblems but store the 
                        //result for the other sub problems..Techniq called memoization                       
  
//5. Back Tracking -- e.g N-queens problem in chess
                     //Just like bruce force,derive all possible outcome but backtrack incase one
                     //doesnt satisfy a certain constraint.
                     
                     
///FURTHER LEARNING IN ALGORITHMS

 //1. knapsack problem
 //2. Find GCD using Euclidian algorithm
